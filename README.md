## Current Abilities

#### Logging
Currently the bot logs all messages (Users agree to this when they join the server as described in the #rules channel) and stores them in a google sheet. These messages aren't used for anything and are not shared. The only reason to log them is to see original messages and messages that could be deleted.

#### Currency
The bot has/will have a currency system that will entice users to communicate in chat. This idea is in development.
See more here: Currency(Coming Soon)

#### Admin Usage
The bot has/will have commands to allow admins to easily moderate the server.
